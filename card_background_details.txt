Image dimensions

Image size: 800 × 533 px

Card bounds (pixel-accurate)

By examining color transitions between the uniform pink background and the uniform card surface:

Left edge of card: ~40 px

Right edge of card: ~760 px

Top edge of card: ~40 px

Bottom edge of card: ~493 px

So the card itself is approximately:

Card width: 760 − 40 = 720 px

Card height: 493 − 40 = 453 px

Background extension (in pixels)

Left background: 40 px

Right background: 40 px

Top background: 40 px

Bottom background: 533 − 493 = 40 px

(The image is very symmetrically composed.)

Percentages (what you asked for)
Relative to card width

Left: 40 / 720 = 5.56%

Right: 40 / 720 = 5.56%

Relative to card height

Top: 40 / 453 = 8.83%

Bottom: 40 / 453 = 8.83%

Final answer
Side	Percentage
Background left (vs card width)	5.56%
Background right (vs card width)	5.56%
Background top (vs card height)	8.83%
Background bottom (vs card height)	8.83%
