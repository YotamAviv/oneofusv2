# UX Specification: ONE-OF-US.NET (V2)

This document defines the interface for the V2 phone app, built on the physical metaphor of a high-end Notary Business Card.

## 1. Design Philosophy: "The Tactile Utility"

- **Physical Metaphor**: The app centers on a "Luxury Linen" Identity Card. This creates a sense of permanence, value, and human trust.
- **Zero Clutter**: The primary screen is for encounters only. It contains no personal data, only the QR code and branding.
- **Privacy by Default**: Maintenance alerts are subtle pulsing dots that do not reveal the nature of the issue to bystanders.
- **Unified Management**: All non-encounter functionality is consolidated into a single Management Hub.

## 2. Main Surface (The Identity Card)

The app opens to a high-fidelity business card centered on a neutral surface.
- **Top Left**: Official branding (Logo + ONE-OF-US.NET) in respectable serif typography.
- **Center**: The Identity QR Code.
- **Top Right**: The Pulsing Alert Dot (Red if attention is required).
- **Bottom Right**: The Management Hub Entry.
- **Bottom Center**: The Encounter FAB (Scan).

## 3. Visual Vocabulary

- **Colors**: Natural Cream (#FDFBF7), Charcoal (#37474F), and Site Teal (#00897B).
- **Surface**: Subtle linen-toned backgrounds with deep, soft shadows.
- **Borders**: Thick, layered edges to simulate high-gsm paper stock.
- **Typography**: Respectable, medium-sized serif headers for brand identity.
